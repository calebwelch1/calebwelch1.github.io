or GitHub Projects) What if someone misses a deadline? What happens if someone
misses a meeting? What is their responsibility? What is the team's
responsibility? How does each team member like to receive feedback? What if
there is friction between members? How will you address it? Are there any other
agreements you have made as a team, if so what?
